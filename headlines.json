Over the past two weeks, two important messages were transmitted to Iran, and both were rejected. The first message came from the US. Washington made it clear that it intends to carry out a limited strike and expected Tehran to either 'swallow' it or not respond at all. Iran categorically refused, stating that it is revising the rules of war and red lines and will consider any strike as an act of full-scale war. The second message was sent by Israel through intermediaries. It claimed that Israel allegedly would not participate in the US attack, and Iran was asked not to strike Israel. This request also received a negative response. Tehran clearly stated: in case of the start of a US military operation, Israel will become a legitimate target. It is in this context that Netanyahu's latest threats sound. In parallel, Iran sent warnings to all countries in the region - from Baku to Riyadh, stating that any attack from their territory or through their airspace will be considered as an attack by these countries. According to the source, this was the main reason for the cancellation of the planned US strike last Tuesday night. The operation was postponed, and large-scale offensive and defensive forces were transferred to the region. These steps pursue three goals: deterrence, blocking a possible Iranian response, and preparation for an escalation scenario.",
