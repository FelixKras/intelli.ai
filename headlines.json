Israeli governments throughout the generations hesitated, ignored and abandoned, and into the vacuum entered the murderous Palestinian Authority and worked to establish a terrorist state in the heart of the country. The decisions cancel a distorted reality of racism and discrimination against Jews regarding lands in Judea and Samaria: exposing the land registry that was confidential, canceling the Jordanian law that prohibits the sale of lands to Jews, enforcement against damage to heritage sites and environmental damage in Areas A and B, all these indicate: Zionism is not measured by declarations and talk, but by actions.

Now, the cabinet has ordered the removal of confidentiality and the publication of the land registry, a step that will increase transparency and facilitate land redemption. • The cabinet canceled the Jordanian law that prohibits the sale of real estate to Jews. Until now, Jews were forced to purchase lands only through registered companies and subject to a cumbersome \"transaction permit\" from the Civil Administration. From now on, the requirement for a transaction permit has been canceled and the prohibition on sale to foreigners has been canceled, which will allow Jews to purchase land in Judea and Samaria exactly as they purchase in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Alongside this, the requirement for a transaction license from the Land Registration Officer has been canceled, and in its place only professional threshold conditions will be set, which will lead to the removal of a significant barrier in the local real estate market. • After years of foot-dragging by the Palestinian municipality of Hebron, it was decided to transfer the building licensing authorities in the Jewish settlement, the Cave of the Patriarchs and the additional holy sites in the city, from the municipality directly to the planning institutions of the Civil Administration. The meaning is that there will no longer be a need for a specific \"withdrawal of authorities\" every time they want to make the cave accessible or build in the city for Jews, and the planning procedures will become efficient and independent. Concurrently, it was decided to grant full municipal authorities to the Hebron administration, which will now be able to directly handle the needs of the settlers and prevent hazards, without dependence on the Palestinian mechanisms that until now required a complex and frustrating procedure. • Concurrently, the state is increasing its efforts in the war for heritage and environmental areas: it was decided to expand supervision and enforcement activities also to Areas A and B regarding water offenses, damage to archaeological sites and environmental hazards that pollute the entire area.",

However, the truth is that communist ideology has only cunningly changed its form and continued to spread throughout the world. China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba declare themselves communist. Former Soviet Union countries are still heavily influenced by communist ideology and practices, and countries in North America and Europe are welcoming communist influences with open arms without many people even realizing it. Over 100 years, communism has established massive dictatorships, caused more than 100 million deaths, enslaved billions of people, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war and near destruction. However, the invisible damage is even worse, because communism has declared war on humanity itself - including the most basic human values and human dignity. This special television series reviews the true nature of communism and its secret goal.

Iran categorically refused, stating that it is revising the rules of war and red lines and will consider any strike as an act of full-scale war. The second message was sent by Israel through intermediaries. It claimed that Israel allegedly would not participate in the US attack, and Iran was asked not to strike Israel. This request also received a negative response. Tehran clearly stated: in case of the start of a US military operation, Israel will become a legitimate target. It is in this context that Netanyahu's latest threats sound. In parallel, Iran sent warnings to all countries in the region - from Baku to Riyadh, stating that any attack from their territory or through their airspace will be considered as an attack by these countries. According to the source, this was the main reason for the cancellation of the planned US strike last Tuesday night. The operation was postponed, and large-scale offensive and defensive forces were transferred to the region. These steps pursue three goals: deterrence, blocking a possible Iranian response, and preparation for an escalation scenario.",
