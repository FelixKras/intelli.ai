      "headline": "How the ghostly shadow of communism controls our world (A special NTD television series translated into Hebrew) Many people believe that communism disappeared with the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the communist bloc in Eastern Europe. However, the truth is that communist ideology has only cunningly changed its form and continued to spread throughout the world. China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba declare themselves communist. Former Soviet Union countries are still heavily influenced by communist ideology and practices, and countries in North America and Europe are welcoming communist influences with open arms without many people even realizing it. Over 100 years, communism has established massive dictatorships, caused more than 100 million deaths, enslaved billions of people, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war and near destruction. However, the invisible damage is even worse, because communism has declared war on humanity itself - including the most basic human values and human dignity. This special television series reviews the true nature of communism and its secret goal.

Over the past two weeks, two important messages were transmitted to Iran, and both were rejected. The first message came from the US. Washington made it clear that it intends to carry out a limited strike and expected Tehran to either 'swallow' it or not respond at all. Iran categorically refused, stating that it is revising the rules of war and red lines and will consider any strike as an act of full-scale war. The second message was sent by Israel through intermediaries. It claimed that Israel allegedly would not participate in the US attack, and Iran was asked not to strike Israel. This request also received a negative response. Tehran clearly stated: in case of the start of a US military operation, Israel will become a legitimate target. It is in this context that Netanyahu's latest threats sound. In parallel, Iran sent warnings to all countries in the region - from Baku to Riyadh, stating that any attack from their territory or through their airspace will be considered as an attack by these countries. According to the source, this was the main reason for the cancellation of the planned US strike last Tuesday night. The operation was postponed, and large-scale offensive and defensive forces were transferred to the region. These steps pursue three goals: deterrence, blocking a possible Iranian response, and preparation for an escalation scenario.",
