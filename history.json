    "best_headline": "According to the advisor of General Mohsen Rezaei, the threats of Tel Aviv were not realized, and Iran did not accept any of the signals given to it. Over the past two weeks, two important messages were conveyed to Iran, and both were rejected. The first message came from the USA. Washington made it clear that it intends to carry out a limited strike and expected Tehran to either 'swallow' it or not respond at all. Iran categorically refused, stating that it is revising the rules of war and red lines and will consider any strike an act of full-scale war. The second message was sent by Israel through intermediaries. It claimed that Israel supposedly would not participate in a US attack, and Iran was asked not to strike Israel. This request also received a negative response. Tehran made it clear: in case a US military operation begins, Israel will become a legitimate target. It is in this context that Netanyahu's latest threats sound. In parallel, Iran sent warnings to all countries in the region - from Baku to Riyadh, stating that any attack from their territory or through their airspace will be considered an attack by these countries. According to the source, this was the main reason for the cancellation of the US strike planned for last Tuesday night. The operation was postponed, and large-scale offensive and defensive forces were transferred to the region. These steps pursue three goals: deterrence, blocking a possible Iranian response, and preparation for an escalation scenario.",

To the question of whether we are closer to an agreement or a confrontation, Oded Eilam, former head of the counter-terrorism division in the Mossad and currently a researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs and Security, is cautious but tends to the assessment that the rationale leads to an agreement. \"The holy grail of Iran is the survival of the regime, and the survival of the regime depends on the easing of sanctions,\" he says. However, he warns of the internal dynamics in Tehran: \"This is a regime charged with jihadist fervor, with a struggle between extremists and moderates. Therefore, it is impossible to sign any check - especially when it comes to Trump and Khamenei\".",
