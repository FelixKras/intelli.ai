      "joke": "Suzy Izzard: Imagine if missiles had feelings. One day, a missile zips through the air, glancing down at a sign in Palestine Square that’s displaying targets in the Gush Dan area and thinks, “Really? This ‘rain’ or whatever they call it? I was aiming for a tranquil retirement in a small, cozy area, perhaps near a Mediterranean beach, not plastered on some drab target sign!” Meanwhile, over in Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Minister is addressing the clearly confused missiles, telling them, “Military deployment doesn’t scare us!” as if missiles are terrified of unsightly military uniforms or the awkwardness of team meetings. Picture them buzzing like anxious interns at a company retreat, not sure whether to seize the day or file for a ceasefire at HR after a botched prank on a Wizz Air flight—where fighter jets showed up not for an existential threat, but because a couple of passengers mistook turbulence for a thriller plot twist! Ah, the modern narrative of conflict, it's like trying to make sense of an action movie script written by a committee of clowns and philosophers!",

      "joke": "Lewis Black: So, let me get this straight—Wizz Air had to scramble fighter jets because someone pulled a prank on a flight! A PRANK! I mean, when did flying become more hazardous than a game of charades? You’ve got missiles raining down in Palestine, and we’re panicking about a guy who made a joke about the peanuts being stale! And here I thought the only thing that could hijack a plane was an actual hijacker! What’s next, a game of tag at 30,000 feet? Welcome to the new world order, where the biggest threat isn't terrorism, but a guy pretending to steal the last bag of chips!",

      "joke": "**Jerry Seinfeld**: So, the commander of the Iranian Air and Space Force says that if the enemy makes a mistake, they’re going to respond stronger than ever. I can’t help but wonder, what kind of mistakes are we talking about here? I mean, is it like forgetting someone’s birthday or accidentally sending a text to the wrong group chat? Because nothing says “beef” like a misplaced emoji. \"Oops! Was that a picture of my lunch and not a warhead? My bad! Now I'm sending an airstrike instead of just a slice of birthday cake!\"",

      "joke": "**Jerry Seinfeld:** Isn’t it funny how politicians win elections by positioning themselves as tough guys? It’s like we're just waiting for the Prime Minister of Japan to show up to the parliament with a leather jacket and sunglasses, saying, “I don’t negotiate, I dominate!” I mean, is it politics or an audition for the next action movie? \"Coming this summer: Takaichi Unchained!\" Who knew charisma was just a tough stance on China and a friendship with Trump?",

      "joke": "Chris Rock: Ben Gvir's out here telling the Attorney General, \"I heard you, but your advice ain't getting accepted!\" Man, that sounds like the world’s worst therapy session! It's like someone sitting on a couch saying, “Doc, I hear you, but I’m gonna keep doing me!” That’s like getting a financial advisor who says, “Invest in stocks!” and you reply, “Nah, I’m gonna keep buying lottery tickets instead—way more exciting!” Meanwhile, we’ve got people questioning, “Is there really a crisis with the ultra-Orthodox?” Are you kidding me? No crisis? The only crisis is the denial! In the same room with the Attorney General, holding a meeting where no one’s taking notes but everyone’s taking shots. This is a circus without a tent, folks!",
