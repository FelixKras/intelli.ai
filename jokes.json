One day, a missile zips through the air, glancing down at a sign in Palestine Square that’s displaying targets in the Gush Dan area and thinks, “Really? This ‘rain’ or whatever they call it? I was aiming for a tranquil retirement in a small, cozy area, perhaps near a Mediterranean beach, not plastered on some drab target sign!” Meanwhile, over in Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Minister is addressing the clearly confused missiles, telling them, “Military deployment doesn’t scare us!” as if missiles are terrified of unsightly military uniforms or the awkwardness of team meetings. Picture them buzzing like anxious interns at a company retreat, not sure whether to seize the day or file for a ceasefire at HR after a botched prank on a Wizz Air flight—where fighter jets showed up not for an existential threat, but because a couple of passengers mistook turbulence for a thriller plot twist! Ah, the modern narrative of conflict, it's like trying to make sense of an action movie script written by a committee of clowns and philosophers!",
