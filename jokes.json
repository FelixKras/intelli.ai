      "joke": "Suzy Izzard: Imagine if missiles had feelings. One day, a missile zips through the air, glancing down at a sign in Palestine Square that’s displaying targets in the Gush Dan area and thinks, “Really? This ‘rain’ or whatever they call it? I was aiming for a tranquil retirement in a small, cozy area, perhaps near a Mediterranean beach, not plastered on some drab target sign!” Meanwhile, over in Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Minister is addressing the clearly confused missiles, telling them, “Military deployment doesn’t scare us!” as if missiles are terrified of unsightly military uniforms or the awkwardness of team meetings. Picture them buzzing like anxious interns at a company retreat, not sure whether to seize the day or file for a ceasefire at HR after a botched prank on a Wizz Air flight—where fighter jets showed up not for an existential threat, but because a couple of passengers mistook turbulence for a thriller plot twist! Ah, the modern narrative of conflict, it's like trying to make sense of an action movie script written by a committee of clowns and philosophers!",

      "joke": "Lewis Black: So, let me get this straight—Wizz Air had to scramble fighter jets because someone pulled a prank on a flight! A PRANK! I mean, when did flying become more hazardous than a game of charades? You’ve got missiles raining down in Palestine, and we’re panicking about a guy who made a joke about the peanuts being stale! And here I thought the only thing that could hijack a plane was an actual hijacker! What’s next, a game of tag at 30,000 feet? Welcome to the new world order, where the biggest threat isn't terrorism, but a guy pretending to steal the last bag of chips!",

I can’t help but wonder, what kind of mistakes are we talking about here? I mean, is it like forgetting someone’s birthday or accidentally sending a text to the wrong group chat? Because nothing says “beef” like a misplaced emoji. \"Oops! Was that a picture of my lunch and not a warhead? My bad! Now I'm sending an airstrike instead of just a slice of birthday cake!\"",

It’s like we're just waiting for the Prime Minister of Japan to show up to the parliament with a leather jacket and sunglasses, saying, “I don’t negotiate, I dominate!” I mean, is it politics or an audition for the next action movie? \"Coming this summer: Takaichi Unchained!\" Who knew charisma was just a tough stance on China and a friendship with Trump?",

It's like someone sitting on a couch saying, “Doc, I hear you, but I’m gonna keep doing me!” That’s like getting a financial advisor who says, “Invest in stocks!” and you reply, “Nah, I’m gonna keep buying lottery tickets instead—way more exciting!” Meanwhile, we’ve got people questioning, “Is there really a crisis with the ultra-Orthodox?” Are you kidding me? No crisis? The only crisis is the denial! In the same room with the Attorney General, holding a meeting where no one’s taking notes but everyone’s taking shots. This is a circus without a tent, folks!",

I mean, show me an argument that isn’t ugly and foolish! You could argue, “Hey, what color should we paint the fence?” and somehow it turns into a shouting match about the state of the universe. And here we are, storming over arrangements in yeshivas like we’re planning a wedding—only instead of the bouquet toss, we’re throwing verbal haymakers about who’s got the better interpretation of the divine!",

A border guard pulling over a guy because he’s transporting five American transport planes? “Sir, this isn’t a game of Monopoly!”",

They’re hauling billions in equipment while most of us can barely afford a plane ticket for a vacation! But here’s the kicker—while they're flying to save the world, folks in Tehran are out there with signs in the square like, “Here’s the target!” It’s like they turned a conflict zone into a hipster art exhibit! Who knew war had a better marketing strategy than most startup companies? They’re treating a missile rain like it’s a bad weather forecast— “Don’t worry, folks, just a little turbulence and hopefully this area stays green!” It’s a mess, man, real chaotic energy!",

It’s like watching a toddler jog with scissors—except instead of a band-aid, we're just bracing for an international incident! They’re calling their decisions \"null and void,\" which is ironic because the last time I heard “null and void,” it was my subscription to cable after my last argument with the customer service rep! Look, if I had a dollar for every time a government made a mess of things, I could probably fund a sensible solution—oh wait, I already do, it’s called my tax bill!",

It’s like reading in the history books that while the Silk Road was bustling with trade and spice, somewhere out there, oil was just sitting on the sidelines, sulking because it didn’t get the memo that innovation was the real prize! I mean, when you hear about a “hidden war” against industrialization, do you picture giant oil barrels sneaking around in trench coats? \"Psst! Not here, just a big barrel of crude trying to learn polymer chemistry—don’t tell the sanctions!\" Who knew the biggest competition was a bunch of barrels trying to dress up as value-added products?",

I’d also like to know when the eastern part of the country started playing hide-and-seek. Sounds like the world could use some more playful diplomacy, or at least a good game of tag—which, ironically, is what I'm always trying to avoid at the gym.",

I mean, when did the streets become the stage for Bedouin brawls? You think they’d been waiting for the right moment to settle disputes, but instead, they just took it to the pavement like, “Why argue civilly when we can settle this with a few right hooks?!” It’s like they skipped conflict resolution classes and went right to the interpretive dance of punches. Who teaches these guys etiquette? “Excuse me, is this a public space or a boxing ring?” It’s all so absurd, yet here we are, just trying to find some peace in our neighborhoods!",

It’s like he’s running the most dysfunctional Hollywood studio. How about a rom-com about peace, fellas?

I can just picture Hezbollah in their headquarters: \"What do you mean they're suing us? We thought we were just throwing a birthday party!\" The whole thing is like watching two toddlers arguing over a toy while throwing Monopoly money at each other—except this time, it’s real lives and real money, and the adults are nowhere to be seen!

How do you organize protests against Israel and still manage to get outdone by a narcoleptic sloth in a local election? I mean, who needs enemies when your political strategy is worse than a cat video on mute? They’ve gone from parliamentary representation to chasing down a prayer for just one measly seat!

It's like they’re saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, our priorities are now on par with trying to decide which flavor of ice cream pairs best with chaos!” Who needs law and order when you can just slap a bunch of suits around the table and call it diplomacy?
