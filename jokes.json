One day, a missile zips through the air, glancing down at a sign in Palestine Square that’s displaying targets in the Gush Dan area and thinks, “Really? This ‘rain’ or whatever they call it? I was aiming for a tranquil retirement in a small, cozy area, perhaps near a Mediterranean beach, not plastered on some drab target sign!” Meanwhile, over in Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Minister is addressing the clearly confused missiles, telling them, “Military deployment doesn’t scare us!” as if missiles are terrified of unsightly military uniforms or the awkwardness of team meetings. Picture them buzzing like anxious interns at a company retreat, not sure whether to seize the day or file for a ceasefire at HR after a botched prank on a Wizz Air flight—where fighter jets showed up not for an existential threat, but because a couple of passengers mistook turbulence for a thriller plot twist! Ah, the modern narrative of conflict, it's like trying to make sense of an action movie script written by a committee of clowns and philosophers!",

Forget the Bondi Icebergs, here’s the Bondi Memorial: “Come for the waves, stay for the existential dread!” Meanwhile, the local Jewish community is all, \"Thanks for not talking to Parliament; we’d hate to have a serious conversation disrupt our beach day!” A lovely way to honor the dead—nothing says respect like a side of protests and a sprinkle of political drama, right?

But tell me, does anyone truly win when we’re all just running in circles?” Meanwhile, Kant’s over there calculating the offside rule with the seriousness of a man trying to define morality alongside a touchdown, and if we didn’t realize it was all absurd before, we surely would when Plato pipes up, “You mean they throw the ball, not the ideas?” It’s the age-old question of existence, my friends: does glory taste like nachos, or merely the fleeting joy of imagining a better reality—preferably one with less tackling and more philosophical debates over nachos?",
