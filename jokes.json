If you think about it, that’s just like me at any family gathering; I’m not there to deal with the drama, I’m just praying the dessert table arrives before the chaos—because really, why risk a missile when you can risk your dignity over Aunt Edna’s fruitcake?",

I mean, is that really how we plan a party these days? \"Hey everyone, we'll dazzle you with lights, then promptly return home like a bunch of well-behaved kids! No cake, no ice cream, just a bunch of drones signing ‘thanks for coming’ on the way out!\"",

Show up at the door like a pizza delivery guy trying to pay for last week’s order with a half-eaten slice? \"Sorry, we couldn't coordinate with the U.S. this time, but we figured out a way to put on our big boy pants and handle it ourselves!\" What’s next, a group text to \"just send in the F-35s!\"? We’ve got nation-states negotiating war like they're planning a potluck dinner—“Are you bringing the missiles, or should I?” Who’s in charge here, a bunch of twelve-year-olds with squirt guns?",

What’s your game plan, buddy? Are we doing this or just staring at each other for the next hour?” I mean, imagine if that were applied to daily life. You look in the mirror and think, “You’re threatening my energy, pal! I’ve got a military response for that… well, after breakfast, maybe.”",

I mean, Trump’s got a giant armada in the Gulf – it’s like he’s trying to win a war with a cruise ship reunion tour, and Iran's over there thinking, ‘We can’t look defeated, but we definitely need some of those pesky sanctions lifted!’ Meanwhile, the Iranian people are sitting behind closed doors thinking, \"Can someone please let us in on this game of diplomatic charades? We didn’t ask to be the collateral damage in a reality show nobody wants to watch!\"",

I mean, that's like a cat saying it's not afraid of a vacuum cleaner—only the vacuum cleaner has a much louder personality and can actually turn on its own! And then you’ve got Khaled Mashal from Hamas offering a ceasefire for five, seven, even ten years! That's a guarantee? Sounds more like a warranty on an art piece—you know, you can return it if it just sits there gathering dust for too long! And what’s up with the merchants in the Tehran Grand Bazaar planning protests? Isn’t that just a way of saying, “Can we get a refund on the chaos? This model’s a lemon!” Meanwhile, in Israel, it sounds like Netanyahu thinks Ehud Barak is shameless. Shameless? American politics is still trying to find out what that even looks like! It's a world gone wonderfully weird, like a circus where the clowns only juggle issues that nobody wants to catch!",

Are we going to start checking people’s social media accounts before they can fly? “Sorry ma’am, you tweeted a bad meme about hummus, so just turn around and head back to your heartland!” It’s like a bad parody of an absurd reality show where the prize is simply getting to enter a country without your social conscience checked at the door!",

It’s a diplomatic party where no one shows up, and the only thing everyone agrees on is that the food's going to be dangerously spicy. Honestly, I just want to know, who brings a missile to a potluck? Isn’t there a rule about that?",

Meanwhile, the U.S. is flying drones like they’re just trying to find the right taco stand in Azerbaijan.

It’s like agreeing to share dessert but still being prepared to battle it out over the last bite of cake. Why do we do that? It's as if the moment we sit down to negotiate, we automatically go for the hidden weaponry under the table!",

Covert operations? What are we, secretly delivering pizza? And as if that's not enough, Israel’s Energy Minister is already gearing up to \"take military action\" if they even so much as hear a sneeze from Iran! Folks, this is like watching a bunch of kids playing with fireworks and wondering why they’re shouting, \"Fire bad!\" It’s a circus—only the clowns are running countries and the bigger joke is that we’re all just sitting here, popcorn in hand, pretending we’re not about to get out our umbrellas for the inevitable fallout!",

I mean, it’s akin to hiding in a tree for three weeks and then yelling, “Surprise!” as the fighter jets are scrambled – I guess they really took their in-flight entertainment to a whole new level. Meanwhile, in Iran, the head of the Judiciary is preparing for confrontation like it’s a boxing match with a referee who’s too busy checking his email – because who puts their trust in the enemy when you could just funkily prepare for a showdown with a side of nuclear negotiations as if they were bringing hors d'oeuvres?

Well, now you can buy land in Judea and Samaria like you’re ordering a pizza! And who knew that getting a permit there was more complicated than assembling IKEA furniture? 'Do I need this Allen wrench or is it optional?' We’re in the middle of a geopolitical conflict, and I can’t help but think, ‘What’s the deal with making land buying easier?
